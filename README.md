🎮 Game Hub – AI & Multiplayer Games Platform
📌 Project Overview

Game Hub is a full-stack web application that brings together AI-based reinforcement learning games and multiplayer games under one unified platform.

The project demonstrates:

Reinforcement Learning concepts (Q-Learning, Policy Gradient)

Backend game logic using Flask

Modern frontend using React + TypeScript (Vite)

Clean frontend–backend separation

Real-time interaction and game state management

🧠 AI Games Included
Game	Description
CartPole	Policy Gradient (REINFORCE) agent trained on CartPole-v1
FrozenLake	Q-Learning agent with success-rate evaluation
GridWorld	Custom grid environment with Q-Learning (terminal logic + stats)

Each AI game runs on the backend and returns training results (episodes, rewards, success rate) to the frontend.

🎮 Multiplayer Games Included
Game	Modes
Chess ♟	Player vs Player, Player vs AI
Four in a Row (Connect-4)	Player vs Player, Player vs AI
Number Guessing Game	Player vs Player, Player vs AI

All multiplayer games feature:

Interactive UI

Game state maintained on backend

Frontend pages for gameplay

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Backend Setup (Flask)
cd backend
python app.py


Backend runs on:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

2️⃣ Frontend Setup (React)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Frontend runs on:
http://localhost:8080
 (or the port shown in terminal)

🎯 Game Flow

AI Games

Trigger backend training

Results displayed in frontend result pages

Multiplayer Games

Open frontend game pages

Interact with backend APIs for game logic
